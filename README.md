# Shopify Notificaiton Emails

Shopify provides several notification email templates that combine horrifing email HTML with ruby-based [liquid](https://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-documentation/basics). 

Because writing email templates is pretty much the worst, I created these shopify notification email templates using [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com/features/email-templates/). 

By exporting the template from MailChimp and mixing in Shopify liquid, I created these templates. 

Oh, and they're really only usable by [defete.com](http://defete.com) ;)
